# Plan

## Colors
* [#FDE74C], [Blank], [#0CCE6B], [Blank], [ED7D3A]
    * Will figure out how I'll sort these next commit

## Timeline
### --- Most Viable Project ---
* Completed by 4/24 - Create base page layout
    * How the website is designed as per wireframe
    * Base foundations for part A/B, FAQ, etc
* Completed by 4/29 - Page Content
    * Content added listed in the wireframe, as well as any additional changes made along the way
    * Content just needs to be in working order, will begin going beyond MVP shortly after
### --- Beyond Most Viable Project ---
* 4/30, 4/31 - Beyond MVP (baby steps)
    * Will take these 2 days taking everything a little further
        * In this state I will take steps to make the project look nicer

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* Completed by 5/01
* Project *justs* needs to be able to function as planned, no matter how bad it looks

#### Beyond MVP
* N/A (we'll see after the MVP is done)
